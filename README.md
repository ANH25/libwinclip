# libwinclip
A thin wrapper around some Windows API clipboard functions.

See libwinclip.h for docs, demo1_libwinclip.c and demo2_libwinclip.c for example usage.

Since this is just a small 'library' that does not do much or hide much details,
the Microsoft documentation of the [clipboard API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dataxchg/clipboard) is also useful.
